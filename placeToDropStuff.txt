            I&apos;m studying a bachelor in computer science (2021-2024) at Aalborg
            university(AAU). I have always had an interest in computers, and
            how they work. Therefore I decided to make my hobby my work. Even
            though the basics of computer science was my hobby before I started,
            I have still learned a lot about software engineering and even more
            about what the processes going into software engineering really is.
            Through courses and the group projects at AAU, I have learned to
            challenge myself, which I think is one of my strengths. I believe
            that working together as a team will get you further than you can
            on your own. I have rarely said no to a challenge as I believe that
            if you challenge yourself, you will learn from it, even if you fail.
            There is always a lesson to be thought through success and through
            failures. Lessons you would not want to miss.

            When I&apos;m not working on a hobby project or a school project, I
            enjoy relaxing with some computer games or watch some series on
            the couch with girlfriend. I&apos;m a very social guy and enjoy
            getting to know somebody better or maybe even get some new friends.
            In my spare time I also enjoy spending time with my friends. I&apos;m
            a huge fan of FC Barcelona and watch nearly every game. Either alone
            or with some friends of mine. I also like to go to the gym. Not 
            necessarily to be fit, but I enjoy having to pressure myself to
            the limit to reach my personal goals. For me going to the gym
            strengthens the body and mind.
